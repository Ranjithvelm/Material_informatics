## basic assumption
- its in the form of line (very bad approximation)
- 

whats special property about the error function? J hint:convex

libraries ?
gradient descent - keep on changing the intercept/slope arbitrarily 
and where it is preferred?

dimentionality is important

interpolation vs extrapolation
in context of 3D

Gaussian curve - when adding noise to the data

How prof. created the data file? had a function and add the noise
